<h2>RecipePower is Coming!</h2> 
<h3>Sharpening the Web for Cooks</h3>
<p class="airy">
Is the Web your friend when you're looking for recipes? Or do you find yourself thrashing around between cooking sites, trolling through Google results (again!), trying to remember where that cool recipe you found last week went? If that sounds familiar, help is coming soon. RecipePower is here to give you <strong>one place</strong> to collect, 
organize, share, and get back to all your food-related "cookmarks" from the Web.
</p><p class="airy">
It's not about more recipes. It's about getting a handle on the recipes out there already. Whether they come from a blog, a cooking site, a search engine--<strong>anywhere</strong>--RecipePower is the place to stash them, tag them, find them again...on <strong>your</strong> terms.  Here, the most important thing is what <strong>you</strong> like and how <strong>you</strong> think about your cooking.
</p><p class="airy">
RecipePower is coming soon to a browser near you. Meanwhile, we'd love to hear
your opinions about finding recipes on the Web.
