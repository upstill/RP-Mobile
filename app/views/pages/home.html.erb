<h1>Welcome to RecipePower (under construction)!</h1> 
<br>
RecipePower is "delicious for Recipes": <strong>one place</strong> to store, 
organize and sort through all your food-related "cookmarks" from the Web.
<p>
<br>
RecipePower is coming soon to a browser near you. Meanwhile, we'd love to hear
your opinions about finding recipes on the Web. 
<br>
