<h3>RecipePower: The Best Recipes on the Web, According to...You</h3> 
<p class="airy">
The Web is the greatest library for cooks, <strong>ever</strong>--and the search tools are amazing. But once you've found j-u-u-u-s-t the right recipe, then what? How do you find it again without going through the whole process? If that seems like wasted effort, if you've ever wished you could stash them away in your own perfect collection, welcome to RecipePower. At RecipePower, you collect, organize, share, rediscover and generally splash around in all your food-related "cookmarks" from the Web. Here, you'll also find like-minded cooks on the same quest. Share recipes with, learn from, teach and collaborate with fellow travellers in your neighborhood of the food world.</p>
<h4>What's Different about RecipePower?</h4>
<p class="airy">
There are many recipe-clipping and -sharing sites these days. But most of them either support a limited set of cooking sites, or expect you to wrangle with importing recipes, or both. RecipePower doesn't import anything. Instead, our cookmarks simply remember where the recipe lives. The whole process is a breeze: capture, tag and share a recipe in seconds. And there are no limits to where you can collect from. If you see it in a browser window, you can cookmark it.
