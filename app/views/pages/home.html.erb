	<h2 class="med">RecipePower:<br>The Next Step in Mining the Web for Recipes</h2>
<p class="airy">
	Finding a great recipe isn't just a matter of clicking in and out of Google. It takes smarts--your smarts. Once you've dug through the Google results and found that marvel, do you save it, or does it slip back into the ocean? Doesn't it sound like a waste to just let it go?
</p><p class="airy">
	Unless you have a friction-free way to save your gleanings from the Web, <strong>and you actually use it</strong> then you need RecipePower. See a great recipe and the Cookmark button <strong>instantly</strong> stashes it away for later. No import hassles, no confusing website, just cream. 
	</p><p class="airy">
	As your collection grows, you can tag recipes to make them easier to find, so when opportunity knocks, inspiration answers! Add friends on RecipePower and get tipped off to their findings as well. Pick up on our Channels and Feeds, and new possibilities come to you.

Why not check it out? Sign up (use your Facebook, etc. login if that makes it easier), and we'll get you set up in a jiffy. Or, <%= link_to("have a look around", collection_path) %> first. Either way, the Web is about to get a lot friendlier to you as a cook.
