<h2>RecipePower is Here!</h2> 
<h3>Sharpening the Web for Cooks</h3>
<p class="airy">
Have you ever found the perfect recipe on the Web, only to have to have it disappear back into the Morass?
</p><p class="airy">Wouldn't you like to be able to collect <strong>all</strong> the recipes that seem to be written just for you--no matter where they come from?
</p><p class="airy">Don't you wish you just had a scratchpad where you could jot down and get back to anything and everything that seems appealing...tagged so you can find them again easily?
</p><p class="airy">If so, welcome home. Welcome to RecipePower.
</p><p class="airy">
RecipePower is the <strong>one place</strong> to store, 
organize and sort through all your food-related "cookmarks" from the Web. It's the perfect 
complement to Google, Bing, and every food site you know and love. It's not about more content. 
It's about getting a handle on the vast library that's out there already.
</p><p class="airy">
RecipePower is coming soon to a browser near you. Meanwhile, we'd love to hear
your opinions about finding recipes on the Web.
