<h2 class="med">RecipePower FAQ</h2>
<p class="airy">
You may be amazed to hear this, but "Frequently Asked Questions" are not, in fact, always compiled from actual questions asked by actual users. They're more like "Questions We Thought Up Sitting At Our Desks Because We Needed A FAQ Page". Still, we have to start somewhere. Until people like you actually <i>ask</i> enough questions to compile, here are our Questions We Thought Up Sitting At Our Desks, etc.

<h4>What is this "Tagging" thing?</h4>
<h4>How do I add my own tags?</h4>
<h4>Why can't I...(enter a recipe, compile a shopping list, etc.)?</h4>
<p class="airy">
Two things. First, this is not just another cooking website. There are enough of those already, in our humble opinion. What we see as the most important thing, for now, is a way for people to tie them all together. You can think of RecipePower as performing a storage/earmarking function, complementary to Google's (and others') search function.

Second: perhaps you, like us, have wasted a lot of time with websites that try to do it all without doing any one thing particularly well. We're focusing on making RecipePower as useful and simple as humanly possible on the simple job of keeping and leafing through your recipe findings.
