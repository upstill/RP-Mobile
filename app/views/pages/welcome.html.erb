<h3>Welcome to the Club!</h3>

<h4>RecipePower: The Quick Skinny</h4>
<p class="airy">
RecipePower is for storing <i>cookmarks</i>: links to recipes and other culinary scuttlebutt from anywhere on the Web. Really: if it's on a page in your browser, you can cookmark it. Your cookmarks are gathered in one place, the <strong>Cookmarks</strong> page, which gives you a nice, snappy view of your whole collection, and a simple way to search through it. But the Cookmarks page is also where you can see <i>other</i> collections: those of your friends, and the cookmarks pertaining to various cooking interests. 
</p><p class="airy">
How do your recipes get <i>into</i> your Cookmarks list in the first place? Three ways:
<ol>
	<li>(<strong>NOT</strong> recommended) When viewing a recipe's page on the Web, you can 1) Edit/Copy the URL (contents of the Address Bar in your browser), 2) go to the "Add a Cookmark" page in RecipePower, then 3) Edit/Paste the URL into that page. But really, that's just a fallback for those too shy to Do The Right Thing, <i>viz</i>:</li>
	<li>Much easier is to install our bookmarklet in your browser (see the sidebar). Then any recipe on the web can be added to your collection by just clicking the bookmarklet, thus whisking the current page off to RecipePower.</li>
	<li>Easiest of all is to just grab a cookmark from somebody else on RecipePower. When you're in another Cookmarks list, each recipe will have a <strong>Grab This Cookmark</strong> link. That's all you need to add it to your own list.
</ol>
</p><p class="airy">
When you <span label="label me">add a recipe to your Cookmarks</span>, you can slap any number of tags on it, including tags you invent because they mean something special to you. That way, when you later want to see the recipes you've earmarked for, say, Weeknight Quickies, you just type that tag into the Cookmarks page and Voila! The list shortens to just those recipes. PS When you <strong>Grab A Cookmark</strong> from someone else, you inherit the tags it already has: less work for you! 
<h4>Where to Go from Here</h4>
</p><p class="airy">
Now you have your own collection of Cookmarks--always available behind the Cookmarks link above--but don't go there just yet! Your collection starts out empty, which is not only less than useful, but kind of depressing. Instead, the smart thing would be to install the RecipePower bookmarklet and go find some recipes on the Web (see sidebar).
</p><p class="airy">But why not see what's already available on RecipePower? As always, they're to be found in one Cookmarks list or another. Since yours is empty, do we have a friend for you: Max is our scout scouring the Net for Good New Stuff, and his Cookmarks list is <%= link_to "here", "rcpqueries/new?user_id=1" %>.
