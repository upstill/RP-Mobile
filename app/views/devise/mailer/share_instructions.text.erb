<%# inviter_name = (@resource.invited_by_id && User.find(@resource.invited_by_id).handle) %>
<% inviter_name = @resource.invitation_issuer %>
<% @recipe = Recipe.find @resource.shared_recipe %>

<%= inviter_name || "Someone" %> says: Look what I found on RecipePower (http://www.recipepower.com)

<% @resource.invitation_message.each do |line| %>
    <%= strip_tags line %>
<% end %>

Check out "<%= @recipe.title %>" 
at <%= @recipe.url %>.

BUT WAIT! Rather not deal with this now? Save it to RecipePower and have it waiting for you.
Just click this link: <%= home_url @resource, :invitation_token => @resource.invitation_token %>
